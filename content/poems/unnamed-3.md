- O mighty God, burn my soul alive,
- For I have sinned, beyond all belief.
- O mighty God, where can I find thee?
- In midst of the dark, I fall into insanity.
{.poetry}
- Thine slave can neither hear nor see!
- Shall not purpose be given out of pity?
- Forgiveness sook to no avail; doom is met!
- Shadows so deep, despair does dwell.
{.poetry}
