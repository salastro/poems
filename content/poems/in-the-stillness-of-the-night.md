- In the stillness of the night, 
- My insomnia grips me tight. 
- My soul is tired, cannot rest, 
- And I am left alone, distressed.
{.poetry}
- The moon above shines bright and clear,
- A light in the dark, so near. 
- But still my mind is plagued with thought, 
- And sleep is something I have fought.
{.poetry}
- The stars above dance in the sky,
- A million dreams that pass me by.
- But I am lost in my own world,
- Where sleep is scarce and thoughts unfurled.
{.poetry}
- I long to find some peace of mind,
- And leave my worries far behind.
- But for now, I'll watch the moon,
- And hope my dreams will come soon.
{.poetry}
