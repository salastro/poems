title = 'Abyss of Despair'
+++

- Rest has not been bestowed upon my soul.
- I suffer in silence and crumble inward.
- Meaning useless in the face of the absurd.
- Thousand fights and still a lot to build.
{.poetry}
- Not only my heart aches, but also my body,
- Broken into pieces, shedding tears bloody.
- I long for peace and serenity, love and tranquility,
- Through shattered dreams and endless nights.
{.poetry}
- No cause will salvage myself,
- As engraved on this soul's shelf,
- Wounds run deep beyond belief.
- Screaming in the abyss of despair.
