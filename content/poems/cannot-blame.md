- During night and day, I can't forget your name,
- Through roads, long and wide, memories haunt me.
- I play songs, recite words, maybe then my soul will be freed,
- Despite that, it is still chained by what's been forged before.
{.poetry}
- Through future and past, regret now speaks my name,
- Each step I take, a weight I cannot blame.
- No wish remains to kindle former flame,
- Just burdens wrought by words once left.
{.poetry}
- No matter what I do and do, I still lose you.
- Didn't I give you the sky's stars and my heart?
- Yet now each step I take is without you.
- They lead me further and further, worlds apart.
