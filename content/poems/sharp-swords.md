title = 'Sharp Swords'
+++

- Sharp swords piercing through heart weak,
- Dark nights long, each wound a shriek. 
- Many battles lost, hidden and seen,
- One finds silence between the screams.
{.poetry}
- Through the chaos, I find no meaning,
- A thousand strokes, yet no word,
- Only silence echoes in the void, 
- Lost in an ocean of thoughts, 
- Searching for a thread of truth, 
- But the maze seems endless.
