- I wish to reach stars bright,
- To glimpse their glow as they ignite.
- So bright they shine in the night,
- I wish for a piece of their eternal light. 
{.poetry}
- I can feel the skies calling for me,
- A higher call, towards my fate,
- Yet I shall be fit for such treasure,
- To endure the trials, hard and great.
