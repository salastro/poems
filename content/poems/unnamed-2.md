- While sleep is despair,
- Equations run incomplete:
- Geometry of unsolved square,
- Program with memory that leak.
{.poetry}
- I find my mind bleak,
- As I write on the big canvas,
- As I walk through the street,
- As I think of the rhyme's chorus.
{.poetry}
- Through the city's veins, 
- I wander and stare, 
- Searching for solace,
- In the midnight air.
{.poetry}
- Running in loops, 
- A relentless nightmare.
- Like an old rocking chair, 
- Moments cascade.
{.poetry}
