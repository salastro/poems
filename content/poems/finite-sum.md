+++

- The number of hours we have,
- is a finite sum.
- Each second subtracts a little more,
- yet I want to steal infinity,
- from a universe that won’t allow it.
{.poetry}
- Please, linger near the door,
- hesitating on the edge.
- Fill the air with unsaid words,
- to keep me tethered here.
{.poetry}
- Please, don't just leave.
- Leave something—
- a trace, a breath,
- a memory that I can hold
- in this fragile reality of ours.
