+++

- Life fleeting away, days count bad,
- Like sand passing through my hand.
- I cannot catch even a single grain,
- Let alone catch up to life and not feel pain.
{.poetry}
- The sun still shines, but not for me, too far,
- A dying light I see, behind a prison bar.
- Each breath I take feels borrowed, not mine,
- A ticking clock with no clear sign.
{.poetry}
- Dreams fade like ghosts down a hollow hall,
- Each hope I held now condemned to fall.
- Smiles are masks I barely wear,
- Joy, my friend, it was never there.
