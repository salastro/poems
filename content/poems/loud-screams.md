+++

- Out of the deep night, I hear loud screams,
- Shattering the silence, tearing through dreams.
- They call from the darkness, halting breaths in my chest,
- Haunting me till dawn, leaving no glimpse of rest.
{.poetry}
- They pull my soul, they yell and plead,
- Depriving me from the peace I need. 
- Shadows writhe and stretch their leer,
- Dimming the moon's shine, it cowers in fear.
