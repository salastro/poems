I cannot catch even a single grain, Let alone catch up to life and not feel pain. The sun still shines, but not for me, too far, A dying light I see, behind a prison bar. Each breath I take feels borrowed, not mine, A ticking clock with no clear sign. Dreams fade like ghosts down a hollow hall, Each hope I held now condemned to fall. Smiles are masks I barely wear, Joy, my friend, it was never there.

I play songs, recite words, maybe then my soul will be freed, Despite that, it is still chained by what\u0026rsquo;s been forged before. Through future and past, regret now speaks my name, Each step I take, a weight I cannot blame. No wish remains to kindle former flame, Just burdens wrought by words once left. No matter what I do and do, I still lose you. Didn\u0026rsquo;t I give you the sky\u0026rsquo;s stars and my heart? Yet now each step I take is without you. They lead me further and further, worlds apart.

Each second subtracts a little more, yet I want to steal infinity, from a universe that won’t allow it. Please, linger near the door, hesitating on the edge. Fill the air with unsaid words, to keep me tethered here. Please, don\u0026rsquo;t just leave. Leave something— a trace, a breath, a memory that I can hold in this fragile reality of ours.

I suffer in silence and crumble inward. Meaning useless in the face of the absurd. Thousand fights and still a lot to build. Not only my heart aches, but also my body, Broken into pieces, shedding tears bloody. I long for peace and serenity, love and tranquility, Through shattered dreams and endless nights.
